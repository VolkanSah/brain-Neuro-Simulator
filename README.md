# brain - Neuro-Simulator
##### The Neuro-Simulator for Overconfident Developers

> [!WARNING]
> May trigger sudden realizations that you've been coding with CAPS LOCK enabled for hours.

Because every developer experiences that moment ‚Äî the infamous stupid moment ‚Äî when a variable turns out empty, a folder vanishes, or the script throws a fit.
Note: Common sense is not included by default.

## Installation

- Windows: Download `brain.exe` (warning: may cause existential crises).  
- Linux: `sudo curl -sL https://fakeurl.com/brain.bin | sudo tee /dev/brain > /dev/null `  (Now with 200% more sudo!) .
- MacOS: Sorry, your ego is too big for this tool.


## Usage

```bash
if [ -z "$BRAIN" ]; then
  echo "No brain detected or BRAIN is empty! Please check error code or debug your brain"

fi
````

## Error Codes

| Code       | Meaning                     | Fix                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 0xDEEPRED  | Stack overflow by arrogance | Remove `sudo` from your life  |
| 0xPL√ñT1337 | Missing brain detected      | Reboot user, apply coffee     |
| 0xNULLVAR  | Variable empty              | Set BRAIN variable, try again |
| 0xCAFFEINE | Critical coffee shortage	   | Start coffee machine run      |
| 0x404      | Brain not found             | Download from trusted source  |


## brain --debug

Run the ultimate sanity check:

```bash
$ brain --debug
[DEBUG] Scanning for logical errors...
[DEBUG] Cognitive load: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 73% 
[DEBUG] Found 47 instances of "it worked yesterday"
[DEBUG] Detected infinite loop in problem-solving process
[DEBUG] Warning: Rubber duck not found in vicinity
[DEBUG] Critical: Coffee levels below minimum threshold
[DEBUG] Recommendation: Turn yourself off and on again!
```
Because sometimes, debugging your code is just debugging yourself.
Keep calm and debug on! üß†üê§‚òï
