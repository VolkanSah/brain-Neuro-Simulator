# brain.exe / brain.bin

**The ultimate brain simulator for all OS.**  

Because every developer has *that moment* ‚Äî the legendary stupid moment ‚Äî when a variable is empty, a folder is missing, or your script just decides to throw a tantrum.  
### Note: common sense is *not* installed by default.


## Installation

- Windows: Download `brain.exe` (warning: may cause existential crises).  
- Linux: `wget https://example.com/brain.bin && chmod +x brain.bin`  
- MacOS: Sorry, your ego is too big for this tool.


## Usage

```bash
if [ -z "$BRAIN" ]; then
  echo "No brain detected or BRAIN is empty! Please install brain.exe or brain.bin"
fi
````

## Error Codes

| Code       | Meaning                     | Fix                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 0xDEEPRED  | Stack overflow by arrogance | Remove `sudo` from your life  |

## brain --debug

Run the ultimate sanity check:

```bash
$ brain --debug
[DEBUG] Scanning for logical errors...
[DEBUG] Found 47 instances of "it worked yesterday"
[DEBUG] Detected infinite loop in problem-solving process
[DEBUG] Warning: Rubber duck not found in vicinity
[DEBUG] Critical: Coffee levels below minimum threshold
[DEBUG] Recommendation: Turn it off and on again (yourself)
```
Because sometimes, debugging your code is just debugging yourself.
Keep calm and debug on! üß†üê§‚òï
