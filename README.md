# brain.exe / brain.bin

**The ultimate brain simulator for all OS.**  

Because every developer has *that moment* â€” the legendary stupid moment â€” when a variable is empty, a folder is missing, or your script just decides to throw a tantrum.  
### Note: common sense is *not* installed by default.

## Installation

- Windows: Download `brain.exe` (warning: may cause existential crises).  
- Linux: `wget https://example.com/brain.bin && chmod +x brain.bin`

## Usage
