# brain.exe / brain.bin
**The Neuro-Simulator for Overconfident Developers**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** May cause sudden realizations that you've been coding with CAPS LOCK on for 3 hours.  


Because every developer has *that moment* ‚Äî the legendary stupid moment ‚Äî when a variable is empty, a folder is missing, or your script just decides to throw a tantrum.  
### Note: common sense is *not* installed by default.


## Installation
*Now with existential dread as a service!*  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** May cause sudden realizations that you've been coding with CAPS LOCK on for 3 hours.  

- Windows: Download `brain.exe` (warning: may cause existential crises).  
- Linux: `sudo curl -sL https://fakeurl.com/brain.bin | sudo tee /dev/brain > /dev/null `  (Now with 200% more sudo!) .

## brain --debug

Run the ultimate sanity check:

```bash
$ brain --debug
[DEBUG] Scanning for logical errors...
[DEBUG] Cognitive load: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 73% 
[DEBUG] Found 47 instances of "it worked yesterday"
[DEBUG] Detected infinite loop in problem-solving process
[DEBUG] Warning: Rubber duck not found in vicinity
[DEBUG] Critical: Coffee levels below minimum threshold
[DEBUG] Recommendation: Turn yourself off and on again!
```
Because sometimes, debugging your code is just debugging yourself.
Keep calm and debug on! üß†üê§‚òï
